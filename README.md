# Weather Dashboard Challenge

The goal of this project was to make an application that checked the current weather and gave a five-day forecast using a server-side API.

To complete this task I did the following:
    Made two API calls to openweathermap.org- one to get the latitude and longitude of the user's desired city, and one to get the weather for that city.
    Utilized the information received from the API calls and dynamically generated DOM elements to display the current weather, and the weather for the following five days.
    Used local storage to save user's searches and generated buttons in the DOM for each of those saved cities.
    Used several third party APIs to streamline the creation of this application: moment.js, jQuery, and Bootstrap.

By completing this challenge I learned about and gained experience using server-side APIs. This opens up so many possibilities for future applications that it is almost overwhelming. I am also grateful for the extra practice using third-party APIs. I feel much more comfortable using jQuery and Bootstrap and now enjoy using both.
